- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Tatu1979. 
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learn Python and try to find out ideas to make something with Python. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and other issues about different kind of systems and programs, but I havenÂ´t coded much, but I understand code quite much. My coding skills is limited,but I try to make them
better by learning all the time something new. Python is important language so I would like to make me better understand Python. Other languages are also familiar to me, but IÂ´m not real coder. I try to update my
skills, back to track :) In the case you would like to contact me, please send me message
